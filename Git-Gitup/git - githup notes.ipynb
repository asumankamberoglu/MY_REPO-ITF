    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another way: you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in C4 and reapply it on top of C3. In Git, this is called rebasing. With the rebase command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on a different branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, you would check out the experiment branch, and then rebase it onto the master branch as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git checkout experiment\n",
    "$ git rebase master\n",
    "First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...\n",
    "Applying: added staged command\n",
    "This operation works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you‚Äôre on and the one you‚Äôre rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you‚Äôre on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git checkout master\n",
    "$ git merge experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the snapshot pointed to by C4' is exactly the same as the one that was pointed to by C5 in the merge example. There is no difference in the end product of the integration, but rebasing makes for a cleaner history. If you examine the log of a rebased branch, it looks like a linear history: it appears that all the work happened in series, even when it originally happened in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, you‚Äôll do this to make sure your commits apply cleanly on a remote branch‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâperhaps in a project to which you‚Äôre trying to contribute but that you don‚Äôt maintain. In this case, you‚Äôd do your work in a branch and then rebase your work onto origin/master when you were ready to submit your patches to the main project. That way, the maintainer doesn‚Äôt have to do any integration work‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâjust a fast-forward or a clean apply.\n",
